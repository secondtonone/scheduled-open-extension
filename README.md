- **Open [the extensions page](chrome://extensions)** in your browser: `chrome://extensions`. This link works on any chromium-based browser.
- If you did not do it already, **toggle the "developer mode"**. This is usually a toggle button at the top right of the extensions page.
- Click the button **_load unpacked extension_**.
- In the window that pops up, **select the folder that contains this minimal extension**, then **click _ok_**.
- **Done!** A new extension called _Chrome Addon v3 Starter_ should have appeared in the list.

## Q&A
> Does this work only on Chrome or on **other web browsers** as well?

At the moment, this works on every chromium-based web browser that supports v3 extensions.
Therefore, you should be able to install this extension on any of the following browsers (as long as they are up-to-date):
- _Free and open-source browsers_:
    - Chromium
    - Brave
- _Proprietary browsers_:
    - Chrome
    - Edge
    - Vivaldi
    - Opera

> How do I **uninstall** this extension from my browser?

- Go to the [extensions page](chrome://extensions): chrome://extensions.
  There should be a card with the name of this extension as title.
  If you don't see such a card, it means the extension is not installed.
- Simply click the _Delete_ button at the bottom of the card. Click _ok_ if a popup asks you for confirmation. The extension is now uninstalled.
